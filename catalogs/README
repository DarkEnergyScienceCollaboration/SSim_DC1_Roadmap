dc1_bright_stars.txt
--------------------
dc1_bright_stars.txt is a catalog of all of the bright stars that were replaced
with dimmer sources in the DC1 PhoSim images.  Because PhoSim takes a very long
time to simulate bright sources, we replaced all stars with magnitude < 10
(technically, with PhoSim normalizing magnitudes < 10) with magnitude = 10
stars.  This catalog lists all of the stars that were replaced in this way.
The columns of the catalog are

uniqueId -- an integer uniquely identifying the star

raJ2000 -- the mean (no propermotion) RA of the source in decimal degrees

decJ2000 -- see above

phoSimMagNorm -- the PhoSim normalizing magnitude (AB magnitude in a delta
function bandpass at 500 nm)

rmag...ymag -- the observed LSST magnitudes of the source (including extinction
due to Milky Way dust).
