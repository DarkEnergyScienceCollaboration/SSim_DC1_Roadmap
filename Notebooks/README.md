These notebooks contain demonstration material convering how to access and use the DC1 datasets. They include instructions for both direct Butler access and indirect access through HDF5 files extracted from the database and read with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

The ["Dask" subdirectory](./Dask) contains examples of how to use [Dask](https://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/) to do out-of-memory operations on large HDF5 files and build smaller Pandas dataframes that you can use in memory.  You can also download the HDF5 files to your own machine.

Not all of these notebooks should be expected to "just work" without modification. They are written by various group members and downloaded from SSim meeting presentations. For this reason, you may sometimes have to modify the expected input file locations or obtain the needed input files etc.  However, the information in these files will give you the background you need to write your own analysis and validation programs. Several of the oldest and most obsolete notebooks have been archived in the ["Deprecated" subdirectory](./Deprecated).
