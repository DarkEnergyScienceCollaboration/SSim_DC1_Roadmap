These notebooks contain demonstration material convering how to access and use the DC1 datasets. They include instructions for both direct Butler access, and through files Pandas files extracted from the database and stored in HDF5 files.

The Dask subdirectory contains examples of how to use Dask to do out-of-memory operations on the large HDF5 files and build smaller 
Pandas dataframes you can use in memory.  You can also download the HDF5 files to your own machine.

Not all of these notebooks should be expected to just work with no modifications. They are written by various group members and
downloaded from SSim meeting presentations. For this reason, you may sometimes have to modify the expected input file locations or
obtain the needed input files etc.  However, the information in these files will give you the background you need to write your own
analysis and validation programs.
